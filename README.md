Game Description (Bomberman: Panic Bomber)
Bomberman: Panic Bomber is a puzzle game derived from the Bomberman series. 
In this game, groups of 3 Bomberman blocks will fall from the top of the screen, 
and your job is to make them disappear by forming horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines with at least 3 blocks of the same color. 
The goal is to create chains of explosions that eliminate several blocks at once and earn more points. 
The key to victory lies in learning how to trigger chain reactions by eliminating blocks. In this way, the bar of the giant bomb will fill up faster. 
This bomb is so powerful that when one falls, it eliminates a lot of blocks in one go. This game supports single-player and two-player modes. 
Panic Bomber, originally released for PC Engine arcades, 
has been released for various consoles and platforms over the years, and is known for its fast-paced and addictive gameplay.
